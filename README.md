# Kickstarting Louise’s Fundraiser
## Overview of Project
Louise wants to start a crowdfunding campaign to help fund her play with a budget of over $10,000. Through the analysis of this project, I am able to sort through the data provided to see if there are specific characteristics that make a successful campaign using goal amounts, location, launch dates, and more. Comparing hers to similar ones done in the past will give us a good idea on how hers may go in the future and the best opportunity to plan. 

## Analysis and Challenges
I performed my analysis by getting familiar with the data provided first. I was able to clean and sort the data to better my understanding, whether it be fixing formatting or filtering to only use what was needed. I only want to use data that pertains to what I’m looking for because if not, it may result in false conclusions. With as much data provided, it can be overwhelming. Using relevant information with common denominators will give Louise the best chance. Looking specifically at plays as a subcategory, the US as a location and similar goal amounts, each bring us closer to a conclusion. 
For this challenge, analyzing the outcomes by launch date in the theater category would show us the best time of year for campaigns similar to Louise’s. To begin that, we formatted the data provided to show us the year each was launched and broke that down even further in a pivottable. We had it filtered to see the amount of successful, failed and canceled for each month to make a line graph out of it later. 

Afterwards, I went in and was able to make formulas to pull data out of the Kickstarter to count the amount of success, failed and canceled for different fundraising amounts in the play subcategory. With that information, it allowed me to give a percentage amount for each value on the success rate and failure rate. Many conclusions can be drawn from the line graph created by this data.

## Results 
I was able to conclude from the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date data that the most successful month is May. Towards the end of the year, campaigns are less likely to take place as launch dates are fewer in the months of November through December. This may be common because others know these are the most unsuccessful months.

The Outcomes Based on Goals showed an inverse relationship for successful and failed campaigns. Smaller goals were more successful than larger goals as they are more attainable and realistic. Louise’s goal was over $10,000. The amount $10,000 to $14,999 had a 100% success rate, which is great news for Louise.

A limitation or question I had is where is this data from? Is it biased as was it handpicked based on criteria I did not know about prior or is it strategically chosen to cover a wide range of campaigns and show relevant information? I would have liked to be able to break the information down even more geographically as I believe that plays a huge part in the success as plays or theater productions are more relevant and often seen as a pastime in different areas. 

Based on the average percentage of goals raised or total revenue, it would have been interesting to see what category had the highest to see what people are investing their money into nowadays. A bar graph would have sufficed and shown us that easily. If we had the genre to which each play campaigned, we also could have made a pie chart to see the percentages to see what genre campaigns the most and dug more into how much each raises and compared them on a line graph over each month.
